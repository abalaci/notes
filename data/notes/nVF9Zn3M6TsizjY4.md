## Notes

- High-level, high-performance, compiled (JIT using LLVM) language designed for scientific and numerical computation
- Dynamically-typed, interactive (via REPL), feels like a scripting language
- Multiple-paradigm (fully imperative, partially functional and object-oriented)
- Uses multiple dispatch
- Interoperable with many major programming languages
- Syntax for math operations similar to mathematical formulas
