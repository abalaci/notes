compatibility layer for natively running Linux binary executables on [Windows](./os.windows.md) operating systems.\nWSL allows you to run a [GNU/Linux](./os.linux.md) environment directly on Windows, unmodified, and without the overhead of a dual-boot setup\nor traditional virtual machine.\n\nThrough WSL, you can:\n\n- Install Linux distributions directly from the Microsoft Store.\n- Run command-line tools such as `cat`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, and other ELF binaries.\n- Run Bash shell script and Linux command-line applications.\n- Run Linux graphical applications integrated directly with your Windows desktop.\n- Use GPU acceleration for machine learning and data science scenarios.\n\n## Installation\n\n## Articles\n\n- [Accessing Network Applications with
